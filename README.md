## Project aim

Only a personal project used to learning, practicing and improving my CI/GitHub
skills. A longer term project aim is to automatically generate optimized GitHub
projects for bash, python, C and C++ projects.

## Todo

- bats-mocking
- further bats libraries
- code coverage
- study GitHub collaboration workflows
- rebase git history for initial commits
- push GitHub skills to the next level (use feature branching, merging etc.)
- generation of code measures
- study ci workflows (travis)
- optimization for shell scripting task especially in bash
- documentation (e.g. doxygen for bash)
- bundle results as template

## Hooks currently used without obvious output

- codespell
- shell-lint

## Already tried

### Basic improvable knowledge in the following topics

- pre-commit hooks
- GitHub workflows
- usage of shell and yaml linters
- unit testing of bash scripts via bats

### Good knowledge

- bash scripting
